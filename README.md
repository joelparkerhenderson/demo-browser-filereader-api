# Demo Browser FileReader API

To use this demo, there are three steps.

## Serve

Serve this directory any way you wish, such as with a typical python development HTTP server:

```sh
python -m http.server 
```

## Browse

Browse to the file, such as:

* https://localhost:8000


## Pick

Pick any file that's on your local system, that's a text file, and ideally small, such as a file that says "hello world".

After you pick the file, then you should see the page update the area below the file picker button. You should see the file's text such as "hello world".
